AxKit 2
=======

First of all, don't try and run the usual perl installation routine of
"perl Makefile.PL; make; make install". It doesn't work that way (yet). It might
in the future.

To run AxKit2, extract the archive and enter the directory, and type:

  $ cp etc/axkit.conf.sample etc/axkit.conf
  $ ./axkit

Then point your browser at http://localhost:8000/

To really get started, install Pod::SAX from CPAN, then uncomment the docs
section in etc/axkit.conf and restart, click on Docs, and start reading the
docs.
