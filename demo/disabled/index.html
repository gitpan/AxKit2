    AxKit documentation. Note that this is disabled by default as it requires
    the <code>Pod::SAX</code> module. Install that and enable in
    <code>etc/axkit.conf</code>.
    
    <h1>Demos</h1>
    These are very simple demos to get you an idea of how AxKit2 works.
    
    <h2><a href="xslt/">XSLT</a></h2>
    <p>
    XSLT - eXtensible Stylesheet Language - a templating language which provides
    a very powerful language for processing XML.

    <h2><a href="xsp/">XSP</a></h2>
    <p>
    XSP - eXtensible Server Pages - A language originally designed by the Cocoon
    project and adopted and extended by AxKit to allow dynamic generation of XML
    using a server-side page language. XSP can be very powerful and extended by
    tag libraries which hide much of the functionality, making complex page
    generation simple.

    <h2><a href="tal/">TAL</a></h2>
    <p>
    TAL - Tagged Attribute Language - A new option for AxKit2. This language
    allows you to design your HTML as though it looked like the final output.
    Then you just add some attributes to the elements you need to be "dynamic"
    which indicate which parts of the XML source it should get data from. The
    TAL backend then does all the work and generates a HTML page. Very cool.

    <h2><a href="xpathscript/">XPathScript</a></h2>
    <p>
    XPathScript - A language created to give some of perl's power and simple
    expressability to XML transformation. Like XSLT it is mainly a declarative
    language, but with the added power of Perl you can do all kinds of crazy
    stuff that XSLT forbids.

    <h2><a href="gallery/">Gallery</a></h2>
    <p>
    A full blown demo application - an image gallery.
