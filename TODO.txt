AxKit2 TODO List
================

- Implement Apache::Request-a-like and figure out how to past to Transformers
    - Sort of done. POST/PUT body data goes through the body_data hook. I have
      not yet written a plugin to parse these but it should be straightforward.
      Querystring data is parsed and available via the param() method.

- Implement better output of HTTP headers. Particularly caching headers (ETags etc).

- Add tests (eek!).
    (started)

- Support some form of .config for directories.

- Vhost support

- Support HTMLDoc.

- Support PassiveTeX.

- Allow console to reload plugins

- Catalyst plugin

- Jifty plugin

- SAWA plugin

- Make "make install" work (mostly involves figuring out where to put plugin dir)

- Update axkit.org to reflect AxKit2.
