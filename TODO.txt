AxKit2 TODO List
================

- Implement Apache::Request-a-like and figure out how to past to Transformers
    - Sort of done. POST/PUT body data goes through the body_data hook. I have
      not yet written a plugin to parse these but it should be straightforward.
      Querystring data is parsed and available via the param() method.

- Add logging everywhere at reasonable levels

- Implement better output of HTTP headers. Particularly caching headers (ETags etc).

- Improve file delivery for hook_response. Use AIO.

- When no response plugin triggers, issue 500 error. Implement 404 error in serve_file.

- Implement serve_dir plugin. Should fire at hook_response if we're looking at a directory (or DirectoryIndex doesn't exist).

- Add tests (eek!).

- Add POD docs.

- Support some form of .config for directories.

- Support HTMLDoc.

- Support PassiveTeX.

- Allow console to reload plugins
